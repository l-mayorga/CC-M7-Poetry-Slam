I am like a man deserting his shadow in dark
woods the dog that strayed across the street
with the gait of a horse that drags a very
heavy cart behind it. The horse moves
successfully toward its liberation since it
does not know where he was going,into the
terrible world of children and the brittle
bones of the earth in her divine
indifferencerolls on, and many paltry things
and meanprate to be heard of again.some left
with caravans, wearing native dress â€”
ephemerids.where are they?
