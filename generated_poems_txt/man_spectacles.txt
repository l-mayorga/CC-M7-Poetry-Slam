I am like a man pawing around for broken
spectacles after he wakes in the cold ash of
some war. Gusting upward, lobes and nose on
fire, his whole face florid from the heart
of adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, the
bent of his young mind she sought, for much
the kind preceptress wished to find to what
profession he was most inclined, that where
his genius led they might him train; for
natureâ€™s kindly bent she held not vain.
