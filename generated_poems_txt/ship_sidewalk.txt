I am like a battered ship down the sidewalk,
the moon was full last night: today, low
tide was low: black shoals of mussels
exposed to the air freshener hanging from
the belts of nuns in their habits or priests
in sackcloth balked the scourge of god.
Foursquare by the rite of arm and heart and
law, the scrubby log cabin dared the compass
points of rock spring farm, man’s world,
god’s universe, the babel of trouble starts;
among all the colored dots and mobile
brushstrokes of the french embassy is also
here.
