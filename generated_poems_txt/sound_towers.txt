I am like you / not crazy about that which
towers before me / particularly the
buildings here / and the sound of
“mother-fucker,” the sound of occasional
sirens or barking dogs. In a magazine and
drew a giant moustache high up in space that
the earth has missed you, body, how it wants
you back again after you leave it where it
should lie; yet could not, till itself would
rise, find it, although before mine eyes;
for, in the beginning, in the list of
endangered species.
