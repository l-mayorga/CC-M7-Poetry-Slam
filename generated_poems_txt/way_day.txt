I am like compassion, i go on loving your
smiletill it finds its way even unto them.
One gray day, i was alive on this earth, and
when i say oral emtricitabine you thinkonce
a day swallow a small sun& all hymn in you
comes undonethe way a lit match on the
secrets my body has erupted, system by
system, sick unto itself.
