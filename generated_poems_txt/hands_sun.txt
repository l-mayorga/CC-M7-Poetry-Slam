I am like that grand piano we found one
night on willoughby that someone had smashed
and somehow heaved through an open
window,and the thorn of a rose close when
the rhythm locks; i’ve learned to speak the
rest, who better are forgot, would tire a
well-breath'd witness of the two-thirds of
everything else. Please see that my own
hands in my hair, or what’s left of me, this
i took from your mother’s watery hands,
street vendors in rome, ms. rosie from our
taquería, you: in the sun, behind the sun.
