I am like you / not crazy about that which
towers before me / particularly the
buildings here / and the people learn that
the mystery of how a man should not behave
when burying a wife. All through the night,
o lord, keep thou safe through the night,
hothouse blooms crackling in a seething sky,
then hissing into a boiling sea— was it a
fabulous shoulder gleaming was it an
allegory?a catholic one? (it was a catholic
school.)that would ruin the story.a story is
only good if it’s made upbut convinces you
