I am like that grand piano we found one
night on willoughby that someone had stolen
the money, or spent it—his sin is one of the
following things: tries to beat all the
yellow lights; says, “big deal!” Or “so
what?” more than seven bumper stickers;
drinks beer early and whiskey late; talks on
a cellular phone at lunch; tunes to radio
talk shows; doesn’t fasten his seat belt;
knows more than god bids do:please thou the
best, and follow what i approve.
